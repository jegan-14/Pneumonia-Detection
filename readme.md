# Pneumonia Detection Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Pneumonia is a serious respiratory condition that can be life-threatening if not diagnosed and treated promptly. The model leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze and classify the images.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jegan-14/pneumonia-detection.git
   cd pneumonia-detection
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run in localhost:

   ```sh
   cd Back End/Server
   python app.py
   ```

5. Open the `index.html` in Front End
